# Chat app with React + Firebase

CRUD app made with React and Firebase. Once you login with Goolgle you will be given a random Robot name and profile picture. You can send a new message, delete your sent messages or vote on any message.

Inspired by Fireship's [React Firebase Chat Tutorial](https://youtu.be/zQyrwxMPm88)
